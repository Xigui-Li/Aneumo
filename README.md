## Project Overview

**Aneumo** is a large-scale, comprehensive cerebral aneurysm hemodynamics dataset designed to advance machine learning and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research related to cerebral aneurysms. The dataset includes:

- 10,660 high-precision 3D models generated through controlled deformation techniques based on 427 real aneurysm geometries
- 85,280 hemodynamic simulation data sets under 8 different flow conditions
- Medical imaging-style segmentation masks and multiple data representation formats

**Figure 1:**  Workflow for deforming patient-specific aneurysm models and simulating vascular hemodynamics.  (a) Patient-derived aneurysmal geometries are first processed to remove the aneurysm and recover a healthy vascular shape. Controlled geometric deformations are then applied to generate synthetic aneurysm models.  (b) CFD meshes are created for the deformed geometries, followed by simulations of blood flow velocity and pressure fields for hemodynamic analysis.

This project also provides two deep learning CFD surrogate modeling code implementations for efficient prediction of hemodynamic parameters:

1. DeepONet-based model
2. Hybrid model combining Swin Transformer with DeepONet

## Dataset Features and Contributions

### Key Contributions

1. **First Large-Scale High-Fidelity Hemodynamics Dataset**: Provides 85,280 hemodynamic data samples (velocity/pressure fields) generated through CFD simulations under various physiological flow conditions (0.001â€“0.004 kg/s), filling a critical gap in AI-driven hemodynamic modeling.
2. **Diverse Aneurysm Geometry Evolution Data**: Based on 427 real aneurysm geometries, 10,660 high-quality 3D models were generated through controlled deformation techniques, comprehensively capturing aneurysm geometric evolution across different stages and supporting quantitative modeling of rupture risk.
3. **Multimodal Data Fusion Framework**: The dataset includes high-resolution binary segmentation mask images precisely aligned with CFD parameters, supporting multimodal learning tasks and facilitating multi-scale feature mapping in complex flow environments.

### Data Format and Organization

The dataset provides multiple formats to support different research tasks:
